# CrunchApp, an app for Cruncho

## ASSIGNMENT
Using any places api, a view framework and a state management framework of choice - create an SPA which will show a list of 10 nearby restaurants and the distance in kilometers from your current location.
Recommended stuff:  TypeScript, create-react-app, google places api / HERE api.
Any creative addition to the application is welcome. Adding a “killer feature” VERY welcome :)


## Library Used
Axios: for better rest requests management (error handling, etc)
